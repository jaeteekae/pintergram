Decisions
=========

	To make our API, we decided to use Django-Rest-Framework. This decision was
made because it was the first approach we tried, and their tutorials were 
thorough enough that we were able to set it up and understand it. 
	For both Users and Posts, two serializers each were used. This was to 
ensure that, when updating a post or a user, the API does not require 
all fields be provided. However, when creating a new user or post, all 
fields will still be required.
