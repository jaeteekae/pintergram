##Team 14##

No Python packages were used.

Dependencies:
* Django==1.7.4
* Pillow==2.7.0

We spent approximately 12 hours learning Python and Django & 6 hours implementing the MVP

We had challenges with:
* figuring out how to create and then render a post that didn't have both a caption and a picture
* sending both a list of posts and a list of tags as context, then iterating through them together
* displaying the tags uniformly
